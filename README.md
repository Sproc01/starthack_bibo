# START HACK 2025 - BIBO X Syngenta Challenge

## üå± Project Overview

This is an AI-enabled solution developed during START HACK 2025 in St. Gallen for Syngenta's challenge: "Nature helps nature: Use AI to improve global farming through nature-powered innovation." Our platform helps farmers in India and Brazil make more informed decisions about biological product usage based on their specific conditions.

## üí° Problem Statement

Farmers worldwide face a critical challenge in selecting optimal crop treatments due to:

- Limited data on treatment efficacy across varying climates and soil conditions
- Difficulty predicting how treatments perform in specific local environments
- Inability to accurately assess which solutions will maximize yields while minimizing costs

This knowledge gap leads to suboptimal yields, wasted resources, and reduced farm profitability.

## üöÄ Solution

Our project addresses these challenges through an AI-powered platform.

The key components of our solution are:

### 1. Comprehensive Historical Data Collection

- Downloaded and processed weather forecast data spanning the last 50 years
- Included parameters such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, and soil features
- Organized data by geographic regions to ensure localized predictions
- Created a robust dataset that captures seasonal patterns and climate change trends

### 2. Advanced AI Prediction Model

- Implemented a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model architecture that specializes in different risk factors
- Trained the model to predict potential risks for various crop types based on weather patterns
- Achieved up to 99% prediction accuracy for major risk events up to 3 weeks in advance
- Lightweight models allow for real-time predictions and updates + low computational costs and environmental impact helped by heavy caching

### 3. Accessible Farmer Interface

- Developed a user-friendly web application for farmers to access predictions
- Implemented location-based risk assessments for specific fields and crops
- Created visualization tools to communicate risk levels through intuitive charts and maps
- Provided recommendations for optimal biological product usage based on predicted risks
- A powerful funnel which converts the tool in customer fidelization and increased sales for Syngenta
